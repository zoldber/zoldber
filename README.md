Welcome!

I'll be migrating a few personal projects here with the aim of organizing and documenting them properly. Many of these repos will be active projects, though some will be simpler undertakings from college etc. that I found interesting or useful. A long-standing interest of mine and a large part of my achademic background is in machine learning applications supporting autonomous locomotion (bipedal stabilization, routing, and - to a lesser extent - agent perception). My programming experience is overwhelmingly in C++ but I've used a healthy amount of Python for developing and training ML models (Tensorflow and Pytorch). I'm currently learning the MERN stack.

Thanks for reading; I'm always open to collaboration!
